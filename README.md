# Creating a System with MERN

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## MERN

This directory makes use of:

### MongoDB

MongoDB is the database used for this system.

### ExpressJS

ExpressJS is the framework used to connect the front-end to the back-end

### ReactJS

ReactJS is used to develop the front-end of the system.

### NodeJS

NodeJS is the web server used in the system.

### How To Run

'npm run dev' will run both the frontend and backend at the time of updating this.

This is possible by making use of concurrently which was installed with 'npm i concurrently' in the root directory.
